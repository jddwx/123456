### MY DREAMS:
* Make armless people more convenient and comfortable to use the computer

### SOME PROBLEMS：  
##### （How do I...）
* Make this device wearable for the armless
* Use this device to control computer
* Make this device wireless

### STH I ALREADY KNOW
* Now people can use bluetooth or infrared to operate wirelessly

### STH I want to know
* What kind of way do armless disabled people use computers nowadays
* Is there such a product now? How much does it cost?
